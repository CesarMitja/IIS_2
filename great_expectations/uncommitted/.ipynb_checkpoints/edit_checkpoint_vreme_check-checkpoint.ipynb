    "Glad you asked! Checkpoints are very versatile. For example, you can validate many Batches in a single Checkpoint, validate Batches against different Expectation Suites or against many Expectation Suites, control the specific post-validation actions based on Expectation Suite / Batch / results of validation among other features. Check out our documentation on Checkpoints for more details and for instructions on how to implement other more advanced features including using the **Checkpoint** class:\n",
